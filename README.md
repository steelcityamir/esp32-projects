# ESP32 Projects
This is a repository of code I've written for NodeMCU-32S microcontroller which is part of the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the code in this repository:

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/steelcityamir/esp32-projects.git
```

**Install the PlatformIO VSCode extension**

PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a cross-platform, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) and debugger for embedded software development. It's a tool for software developers and embedded systems engineers that can be used for both personal and commercial projects.

1. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Code. PlatformIO IDE is built on top of it.
2. Open VSCode Extensions.
3. Find and install PlatformIO IDE.

**Upload to ESP32** 

Connect your ESP32 board to your computer and upload the code.
