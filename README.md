# esp32-projects
This is a repository of code I've written for NodeMCU-32S microcontroller which is part of the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the code in this repository:

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/steelcityamir/esp32-projects.git
```

**Install the PlatformIO VSCode extension**

PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a cross-platform, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) and debugger for embedded software development. It's a tool for software developers and embedded systems engineers that can be used for both personal and commercial projects.

**Upload to ESP32** 

Connect your ESP32 board to your computer and upload the code.
